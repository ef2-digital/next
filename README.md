## How to use

```bash
# 1.
yarn create next-app --typescript -e https://github.com/ef2-digital/next
```

The library `@ef2-digital/react` is (not yet!) online. For now execute the following steps:

2. Clone `https://github.com/ef2-digital/react`
3. Run `yarn install` and `yarn build`.
4. Run `yarn link`.
5. Open your created project (from step 1.) and run `yarn link "@ef2-digital/react"`
